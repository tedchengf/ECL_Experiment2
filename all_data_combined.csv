2,Large Red Circle,
3,Small Red Circle,
5,Large Red Triangle,
7,Small Red Triangle,
11,Large Blue Circle,
13,Small Blue Circle,

"Note that the coding of L2 stimuli are reversed (for example, small blue triangle is coded to be 2).  ",,
"As the result, both lists will have the same ground truth for both the training and the generalization trials,",,
so L1 and L2 can be treated as the same list,,
,,
Below are the coding schemes for the columns,,
Coding,Stimuli,Entry Explanations
Subname,Subject Name,Unique Identifiers
List,Stimuli List,"L1 and L2 are list 1 and 2. Since L2 are inverted, they can be treated as the same list"
Formula_Type,Type of Ground Truth,"T1: Tenary Spec, Object; T2: Tenary Spec, Distributive; B1: Binary Spec, Object; B2: Binary Spec, Distributive; S1: Singular Spec"
